# AI + Entrepreneurship Education Cookbook - Prompts
This workbook serves as a series of examples which entrepreneurship educators can consider as they are looking to augment or simulate different situated aspects of entrepreneurship. This cookbook will be updated and will serve as a guideline to assist instructors in how to see AI as a copilot in the classroom. Note that we primarily use Python and a series of required libraries to interface with various APIs and process data. We also strive to use models that other instructors and researchers could access - you could easily use some of the prompts below with a tool like ChatGPT. (Also, one can simulate the dialogue fine-tuning by using other OpenAI products or libraries like LangChain). As always with output, you should question what you are reading. Is this accurate? Is this a hallucination from the model? You can always submit bad advice or errors to the project [here](https://tally.so/r/wo91Pe)
