# AI-in-Entrepreneurship-Education
Public repository for use of AI in Entrepreneurship Education.
There are two primary files that can be used at this time - the [technical cookbook](https://github.com/josephdfox/AI-in-Entrepreneurship-Education/blob/main/AIEE-Cookbook-Online.ipynb) and the [prompt cookbook](https://github.com/josephdfox/AI-in-Entrepreneurship-Education/blob/main/AIEE-Cookbook-Prompts.ipynb). Both files will be added to over time.

You can use prompts in any LLM like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) or even [OpenAI's Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground). 

The technical cookbook is availble as a [Notebook](https://jupyter.org/). You will need your own API key from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/). The Technical Cookbook has been updated to incoprorate LangChain's ChatGPT integration.
