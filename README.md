# AI-in-Entrepreneurship-Education
Public repository for use of AI in Entrepreneurship Education.
There are two primary files that can be used at this time - the [technical cookbook](https://github.com/josephdfox/AI-in-Entrepreneurship-Education/blob/main/AIEE-Cookbook-Online.ipynb) and the [prompt cookbook](https://github.com/josephdfox/AI-in-Entrepreneurship-Education/blob/main/AIEE-Cookbook-Prompts.ipynb). Both files will be added to over time.
